## Description
This is challenge one for UTA bootcamp. It was made to show how an index file's structure could be changed in order to better understand what we could use instead of divs. I also made the code more functionable and cut down the amount of unneeded code. The only technology used for this project was CSS and HTML. Some of the challenges faced in this project would have been to find the proper way to make the assignment more profesional.
